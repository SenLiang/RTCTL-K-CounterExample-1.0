# RTCTL-K-CounterExample-1.0

Symbolic Counter-example Generation for Discrete Real-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic

We first define the syntax and semantics of RTCTL*K, extend the temporal Verification tool Framework-JTLV 1.4.0 coding by Java, modify the syntax file, propose and implement the counterexample generation algorithm of RTCTL*K for the first time. In order to produce a tree-like counterexample diagram for the formula that does not hold, then display it graphically and visually, and develop a model checker MCTK2.0.
